Essentially by the end of these ten tasks I want the frontend to request a SPRINT by it's ID and get returned the
sprint object with the list of Tasks that have lists of SubTasks. This will require a slight restructure of the backend endpoints.
The dummy data needs to be updated to correctly reflect this (15 tasks + 2/3 subtasks each should be enough for now).
After this I will pause forward development to begin abstracting the frontend code so it is more readable.

TODO CURRENT LIST:
Error handling
Reception delay
Sprint page date range selector (Selector finished, date parsing needed)
Today page
Sprint/Today/Future page add button (animate up cirle)
Add subtask feature
Task more pop up (split into two - view and edit, also used for add)
Page titles
Status posting/updating
Sprint data structure
Dto's
Widget card implementation
Widget graphs


FUTURE:
Authorization/Authentication (JWT)
Roles
Accounts
Groups?
Collborative boards?
