# Personile
##### Personile an agile-inspired project management software geared towards student projects in all disciplines. The project utilizes the .NET framework for the backend using the C# language. The front end of the application is written in Typescript utilizing React, Redux, and Material UI. The application showcases complex relational data and user authentication. The project also highlights several algorithms that optimize the response time of actions on the frontend as well as algorithms that predict and recommend user selections for an improved visual experience. I used GitHub actions to develop a continuous integration pipleline to streamline deployment to Fly.io.
